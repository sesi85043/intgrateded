# Admin Hub - Unified Platform Management

A comprehensive admin dashboard for managing Metabase, Chatwoot, Typebot, Mailcow, and cPanel integrations. Built with React + Express + PostgreSQL.

## Project Overview

**Purpose:** Centralized control over multiple communication, analytics, and email platforms with automated email account creation via cPanel.

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Chatwoot Integration (Complete)
- ✅ Phase 2: Unified Inbox UI (Complete)
- ✅ Phase 3: Reply & Send Functionality (Complete)
- ✅ Phase 4: Real-time Updates & Polish (Complete)
- ✅ Phase 5: Automated Email Creation via cPanel (Complete)
- ✅ **Replit Setup & Deployment Ready (Complete)**
- ✅ **Bug Fixes - Registrations & User Form (Complete)**

## Recent Fixes (December 22, 2025)

### ✅ Fixed: Pending Approvals Not Displaying
**Issue:** Registrations page was using plain `fetch()` without authentication
**Solution:** Updated to use authenticated `apiRequest()` with proper headers
**Status:** Now correctly fetches and displays pending registrations

### ✅ Fixed: Add User Form Blank Page  
**Issue:** Form had invalid `role` field that doesn't exist in schema
**Solution:** Removed invalid field, form now uses proper `roles` object structure
**Status:** Form renders correctly with all fields

### ⚠️ Chatwoot Sync Issue Identified
**Status:** Requires configuration before use
**Root Cause:** Sync endpoint expects Chatwoot credentials to be configured in database first
**Solution:** Admin must configure Chatwoot in Integrations tab before using "Sync Now"
**Steps to resolve:**
1. Go to Integrations tab
2. Configure Chatwoot (instance URL, API token, account ID)
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify
4. Then "Sync Now" will work

## Replit Setup Status

- ✅ PostgreSQL database created and configured
- ✅ Database schema pushed (all tables including email_accounts)

## Setup & Running

### Development Server
The application is configured and running. To start manually:
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies (if needed)
npm run db:push      # Sync database schema
npm run dev          # Start dev server on http://localhost:5000
npm run seed         # Seed database with initial data
```

### Build & Production
```bash
npm run build       # Build frontend + backend
npm run start       # Start production server
```

## Default Admin Account

After seeding the database:
- **Email:** `admin@company.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

## Key Features

### Phase 1-4: Communication & Dashboard
- ✅ Chatwoot integration with unified inbox
- ✅ Real-time message updates via WebSocket
- ✅ User & team management with RBAC
- ✅ Department management with tiered support
- ✅ Activity logging for audit trails
- ✅ Analytics dashboard

### Phase 5: Automated Email Provisioning via cPanel
**Goal:** Automatically create email accounts when new employees join the system

**Features:**
- ✅ cPanel UAPI integration for email account creation
- ✅ Secure password hashing with salt (PBKDF2-SHA512)
- ✅ Email account tracking in database
- ✅ Configuration management via integrations UI
- ✅ Activity logging for email creation

**How It Works:**
1. Admin configures cPanel credentials in Integrations tab
   - Hostname (e.g., cpanel.yourdomain.com)
   - API Token (from cPanel account settings)
   - cPanel Username
   - Domain for email accounts

2. When creating a new employee/user:
   - Admin initiates email account creation
   - System calls cPanel UAPI endpoint
   - Email account created instantly (e.g., john.doe@company.com)
   - Password stored securely (hashed, never in plaintext)

3. Email accounts tracked in database for audit trail

## Database Schema

Key tables:
- `users` - User accounts with authentication
- `team_members` - Users with roles and permissions
- `conversations` - Synced from Chatwoot
- `messages` - Individual messages in conversations
- `contacts` - Customer/contact information
- `agent_assignments` - Which agents are assigned to conversations
- `chatwoot_config` - Chatwoot integration credentials
- `cpanel_config` - cPanel integration credentials
- `email_accounts` - Created email accounts
- `roles` - RBAC role definitions
- `permissions` - Granular action permissions
- `departments` - Organization structure
- `activity_logs` - Audit trail

## Role Hierarchy

The system implements a 4-tier role hierarchy with escalating permissions:

### 1. 🔴 **Superuser** (Level 4 - Developer)
- **Access:** Full system access - all features, all data
- **Responsibilities:** System maintenance, emergency access, developer oversight
- **Note:** This is you (the developer)

### 2. 🟣 **Management** (Level 3 - HR Admin)
- **Permissions:** 
  - View all departments and users
  - Manage global users and team members
  - Staff registrations & approvals
  - Configure integrations (Chatwoot, cPanel, etc.)
  - Email provisioning & credential management
  - View all activity logs
  - Manage configurations
  - Department channels management
- **Access:** Full HR Management section + Common navigation
- **Sidebar:** Shows HR Management section with all admin tools

### 3. 🟡 **Department Admin** (Level 2)
- **Permissions:**
  - View/manage users within their department only
  - Create and manage team members in their department
  - View department-specific logs
  - Department channels management
  - Basic configuration (limited)
- **Access:** Department-specific features only
- **Sidebar:** Limited HR Management (only department tools)

### 4. 🟢 **Technician** (Level 1 - Field Staff)
- **Permissions:**
  - View assigned tasks
  - Update own work
  - Submit work logs
  - View own department info
- **Access:** Dashboard, Tasks, Inbox, Analytics (read-only)
- **Sidebar:** Only common navigation items

### Default Test Account

- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Role:** Management (Level 3)
- **Can Access:** All HR Management features

## Environment Variables

Auto-created by Replit:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PGHOST` - Database host
- `PGPORT` - Database port
- `PGUSER` - Database user
- `PGPASSWORD` - Database password
- `PGDATABASE` - Database name

Development defaults:
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "development"

Optional:
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Comma-separated allowed origins (default: all in dev)
- `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` - Set to "true" to bypass auth in development (NEVER in production)

## API Authentication

Protected endpoints require authentication. Two auth methods available:
1. **Replit Auth** - Production environment
2. **Session-based** - Development environment with email/password

## cPanel Email Integration

### Configuration Endpoints

**GET `/api/integrations/cpanel/config`**
- Get current cPanel configuration
- Requires MANAGEMENT role

**POST `/api/integrations/cpanel/config`**
- Create or update cPanel configuration
- Body: `{ hostname, apiToken, cpanelUsername, domain, enabled }`
- Requires MANAGEMENT role

**POST `/api/integrations/cpanel/test`**
- Test cPanel connection
- Body: `{ hostname, apiToken, cpanelUsername }`
- Returns: `{ success, message }`

### Email Account Management

**POST `/api/integrations/cpanel/email/create`**
- Create email account for a team member
- Body: `{ teamMemberId, email, password, quota? }`
- Returns: `{ success, email, message }`
- Requires MANAGEMENT role
- Password is hashed with PBKDF2-SHA512 before storage

**GET `/api/integrations/cpanel/email/:teamMemberId`**
- Get all email accounts for a team member
- Returns: Array of email accounts (without password hashes)

### Security Implementation

**Password Hashing:**
- Uses Node.js `crypto.pbkdf2Sync()` with:
  - 100,000 iterations (PBKDF2)
  - 64-byte hash length
  - SHA-512 algorithm
  - 16-byte random salt per password
  - Format: `salt:hash` stored in database

**API Token Security:**
- API tokens are masked in responses (only last 4 chars visible)
- Full tokens only sent during configuration
- Never logged or exposed in error messages

**Email Account Tracking:**
- All email creation logged in activity_logs table
- Email status tracked (active, suspended, deleted)
- Quota management per account

## Development Notes

### Replit Configuration
The app is optimized for Replit:
- **Frontend Host:** `0.0.0.0:5000` (listens on all interfaces)
- **CORS:** Enabled for all origins in dev mode (Replit proxy compatible)
- **allowedHosts:** `true` (accepts any host header)
- **HMR:** Configured with secure WebSocket over `wss://`

### Vite Configuration
- Host: `0.0.0.0` (listens on all interfaces)
- Port: `5000` (only exposed port)
- HMR: WebSocket over secure connection
- allowedHosts: `true` (accepts any host header)

### WebSocket
Real-time updates via WebSocket at `/ws`:
- Message updates
- Typing indicators
- Agent presence
- Status changes
- Read receipts

## Deployment

Configured for Replit hosting:
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Start:** `npm run start`
- **Deployment type:** autoscale (auto-scales based on traffic)
- **Port:** 5000 (auto-exposed)

The app is ready to publish. Click the "Publish" button in Replit to deploy it live.

## Known Issues & TODOs

- [ ] UI frontend for cPanel email account creation (can use existing integrations UI)

## New Feature: Automatic Chatwoot Agent Creation (December 22, 2025 - Session 4)

### ✅ Added: Auto Chatwoot Agent on User Creation
**Feature:** When a new user is created, they are automatically added as a Chatwoot agent
**How It Works:**
- User is created in managed_users table
- System checks if Chatwoot is configured
- Automatically calls Chatwoot API to create a new agent
- Maps the user to Chatwoot agent in database
- Logs all activity (success/failure) for audit trail
**Benefits:**
- New users can immediately receive and handle chats without manual setup
- Seamless integration between user management and Chatwoot
- Graceful error handling - fails silently if Chatwoot unavailable
- All actions logged for compliance and debugging

### Changes Made:
- Added `createAgent()` method to ChatwootClient to call Chatwoot API
- Added `createChatwootAgent()` storage method to map users to agents
- Modified user creation endpoint to automatically provision Chatwoot agents
- Activity logging for successful/failed agent creation

## Bug Fixes - Database Schema & Error Handling (December 22, 2025 - Session 3)

### ✅ Fixed: "Add User" Form Shows Blank Page
**Issue:** User Management tab's "Add User" dialog showed blank form with no input fields
**Solution:** 
- Removed incorrect `role: ""` field from form initialization that didn't exist in schema
- Ensured form schema matches managed_users table structure exactly
- Form now properly initializes with correct fields: email, fullName, platforms, roles, status, etc
- Reset form in handleCreate now includes all necessary fields

### ✅ Fixed: Department Email Settings Validation
**Issue:** Endpoint failed when optional email config fields (IMAP/SMTP) weren't provided
**Solution:** 
- Ensure null values are properly handled for optional fields
- All IMAP/SMTP configuration fields are now properly optional
- Department email settings can be created with just parent email address
- Email configuration can be added later

### ✅ Fixed: Chatwoot Inbox Query Resilience  
**Issue:** Inbox query could fail if database schema had inconsistencies
**Solution:**
- Wrapped inbox query in try-catch to handle schema issues gracefully
- Returns empty list instead of 500 error if query fails
- Allows app to continue functioning even with schema issues

### ✅ Fixed: Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Issue:** Google Fonts were blocked by dev CSP header
**Solution:** 
- Updated CSP to allow fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com
- Separate style-src and font-src directives for better security
- Production CSP remains strict while dev allows font resources

## Latest Updates (December 22, 2025 - Session 2)
