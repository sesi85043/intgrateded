Project Report: Integration of Metabase, Chatwoot, Typebot & Mailcow Behind a Unified Reverse Proxy
1. Introduction

This project aimed to deploy and integrate four self-hosted platforms—Metabase, Chatwoot, Typebot, and Mailcow—into a unified, secure, and efficient infrastructure using Docker and a reverse proxy (Caddy). The goal was to centralize management, improve security with automated HTTPS, and enable seamless application-level integrations.

2. Objectives

Deploy all applications using Docker containers

Place all services on a shared private Docker network

Use a single reverse proxy for domain routing and SSL

Provide stable subdomains for each application

Integrate the applications for analytics, automations, and communication workflows

Establish an admin-side user management workflow (create/edit/deactivate user accounts)

3. Infrastructure Setup
3.1 Server Preparation

A fresh Linux VPS was initialized.
Docker and Docker Compose were installed to enable containerized deployments.
A dedicated Docker network, web-proxy, was created to allow easy internal communication.

3.2 Reverse Proxy Configuration

Caddy was selected for its simplicity and automatic HTTPS management.
A Caddyfile was created to map each subdomain to its internal container:

metabase.domain.com → Metabase

chatwoot.domain.com → Chatwoot

typebot.domain.com → Typebot

mail.domain.com → Mailcow (via mailcow’s internal nginx-mailcow service)

Caddy handled TLS certificates automatically using Let’s Encrypt.

4. Application Deployment
4.1 Docker Compose Structure

Each platform was configured in a unified docker-compose.yml using the shared web-proxy network.

Metabase: Analytics + dashboards

Chatwoot: Messaging, support inboxes, automations

Typebot: Conversational forms / chatbot flows

Mailcow: Full-featured mail server (SMTP/IMAP/Webmail)

Mailcow’s internal Nginx + LetsEncrypt were disabled to avoid conflicts with Caddy.

5. Application Integrations
5.1 Typebot → Chatwoot

Typebot webhooks were configured to push form/flow data into Chatwoot inboxes.
Chatwoot’s API allowed:

Creating contacts

Creating conversations

Triggering workflows based on user input

5.2 Metabase Analytics

Metabase was connected to:

Chatwoot’s database (conversation metrics)

Typebot database (flow submissions)

Mailcow database (email activity, logs)

This enabled dashboards covering support performance, user journey metrics, and email system analytics.

6. DNS Configuration

DNS A records were created for each subdomain, all pointing to the server’s public IP.
This allowed Caddy to request valid SSL certificates and route traffic properly.

7. Admin User Management Implementation

A unified admin workflow was designed to allow secure user lifecycle management across all platforms.

Key actions available:

Create new user accounts
Admins can generate unique logins for Metabase, Chatwoot, Typebot, and Mailcow.

Deactivate or delete old accounts
Ensures security hygiene by removing unused accounts.

Modify roles/permissions
Each platform supports granular access control.

Audit existing users
Admin panels allow listing active and inactive users, with activity logs where available.

This ensures streamlined user governance across all systems.

8. Results & Outcome

The final deployment provided:

A fully containerized, isolated, and reproducible environment

Automatic SSL certificates and secure entry points

Consistent subdomain routing for all services

Centralized user and workflow management

Integrated analytics and communication automation between applications

Scalable architecture suitable for future expansion

9. Conclusion

This project successfully consolidated multiple self-hosted platforms into a cohesive, secure, and maintainable infrastructure. With reliable reverse proxy routing, automated certificate management, inter-application integration, and an admin-level user management system, the environment is now production-ready and capable of supporting both operational needs and advanced analytics.
