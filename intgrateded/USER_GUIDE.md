## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Use Private Messages for Notes**
```
Instead of: "waiting on customer"
Use private message: "Customer said they need 2 days to get approval"
```
This keeps your team informed without cluttering the customer's view.

### 2. **Update Status Regularly**
- **Open** → You're actively working on it
- **Pending** → You've replied, waiting for them
- **Resolved** → Issue is solved

This helps other agents know which conversations need attention.

### 3. **Check Unread First**
- Look for blue dots in the conversation list
- These are new messages that haven't been read yet
- Prioritize these to stay responsive

### 4. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Ctrl + Enter** - Send message quickly
- Saves time when handling many conversations

### 5. **Keep Messages Clear & Brief**
- Short, clear messages get faster responses
- Use multiple messages instead of one huge wall of text
- Private messages work great for team notes
