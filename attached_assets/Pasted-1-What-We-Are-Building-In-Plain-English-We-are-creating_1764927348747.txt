1. What We Are Building (In Plain English)

We are creating one central dashboard where your employees can handle all customer communication — WhatsApp messages, emails, and automated chats — without switching between different apps.

Think of it as:

One place to manage every customer message from every department.

2. The Purpose

Right now, communication is spread across multiple tools and inboxes.
After this system is completed:

Staff will log in once to the Admin Hub.

All emails and WhatsApp messages will automatically go to the correct department.

Each department only sees their own messages.

Managers can monitor conversations and team performance.

Customers receive faster, cleaner, more organized support.

3. The Main Tools & What They Do

Here is what each system does, in simple terms:

1. Mailcow – The Email Manager

Receives all company emails (example: support@dtv...).
Connects those emails into the communication system.

2. WhatsApp Gateway (Evolution API)

Connects company WhatsApp numbers to the system.

3. Typebot – The “Receptionist” Chatbot

Asks customers what department they want (“Sales”, “DTV”, etc.).
Sends them to the right team automatically.

4. Chatwoot – The Communication Engine

This is where email + WhatsApp messages come together.
It organizes everything into Inboxes (like “DTV Inbox”, “Sales Inbox”).

5. Admin Hub – The Staff Dashboard

This is what your employees will use.
It displays Chatwoot inside your portal so staff don’t jump between systems.

4. How the System Works (Simple Scenarios)
A. When a Customer Sends an Email

Email arrives in Mailcow

Mailcow forwards it to Chatwoot

Chatwoot creates a ticket in the correct department

Department staff answer the email inside the Admin Hub

Customer receives the reply as a normal email

B. When a Customer Messages on WhatsApp

Customer sends “Hi”

Typebot asks “Which department do you want?”

Customer chooses (e.g., DTV Support)

Typebot sends the message to that department

Staff talk to the customer live inside Admin Hub

5. How Departments Are Organized

Each department becomes a Team inside Chatwoot.

Example:

DTV Department

Inbox Email: support.dtv@company.co.za

Team Members: kayntulo.dtv@company.co.za

Staff in DTV only see DTV conversations

This structure is repeated for Sales, Accounts, etc.

6. User Access Levels (Simple View)
1. Super Admin

Sees all departments

Sees all chats and all emails

Full system control

2. Department Head

Only sees their department

Can monitor all conversations in their team

3. Staff Member

Only sees conversations assigned to them

Or unassigned chats within their own department
