Slide 1: The Executive Summary

Concept: The "Unified Business Operating System" This system is an all-in-one CRM and ERP platform that consolidates over 100 business tools into a single interface. It replaces the need for multiple disjointed subscriptions by combining advanced communication tools (WhatsApp automation), operational management (HR, Accounting), and customer support into one dashboard.
Slide 2: The Core Problem & Solution

    The Problem: Businesses struggle to scale WhatsApp communication because the standard app limits you to 4 devices. Agents cross wires, and data is lost in individual phones.

    The Solution: A centralized inbox (Chatwoot) powered by an integration layer (Evolution API).

        Benefit: Connect a single WhatsApp number and allow unlimited support agents to manage conversations simultaneously.

        Control: Assign specific chats to specific agents, monitor performance, and ensure no customer message goes unanswered.

Slide 3: Key Feature – Advanced WhatsApp Automation

    Multi-Agent Support: Unlike standard WhatsApp, this system allows an entire team (Sales, Support, HR) to work off one business number without getting blocked.

    Smart Chatbots (Typebot Integration):

        Deploy "Transactional Bots" that guide customers through complex flows (e.g., "What is your name?", "Select your issue").

        The bot captures data variables (Names, Issue Types) and automatically passes them to agents or triggers workflows.

        Example: A Real Estate bot that qualifies a lead, asks for their budget, and then routes them to a human agent.

    Campaign Management: Send bulk messages (broadcasts) to lead lists and track delivery reports.

Slide 4: Operational Modules (Beyond Chat)

The system is not just for communication; it manages the entire business lifecycle:

    Sales & CRM: Lead tracking, pipelines, and direct Facebook Lead capture integration.

    Finance: Invoicing, GST accounting, and expense tracking.

    HR & Team: Employee attendance, time sheets, payroll, and internal team chat.

    Project Management: Kanban boards, tasks, and file sharing.

Speaker Notes (Script to go with the slides)

"Essentially, what we are looking at is a platform that bridges the gap between external communication and internal operations. Use cases include:

        For Support Teams: We use the Chatwoot module to turn WhatsApp into a ticketing system. If a customer messages us, we can assign that chat to 'Agent A'. If 'Agent A' is busy, we reassign it to 'Agent B', all while keeping the history visible.*

        For Automation: We don't just reply manually. We use Typebot to build visual flows—like a menu system—that run inside WhatsApp to collect client details automatically before a human ever touches the keyboard.*
